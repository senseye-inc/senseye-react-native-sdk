## Included Tasks

1. Calibration
1. Nystagmus
1. PLR - Pupillary Light Response

## Requirements

Apps using React Native Navigation may target iOS 12+ and Android 10+. You may use Windows, macOS or Linux as your development operating system.

For development, you'll need an IDE plugin that can detect `babel-plugin-module-resolver`.
#### Atom
You can install `autocomplete-modules` and enable "Babel Plugin Module Resolver" in its settings.
#### VS Code
You can `yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver`, then quit VS Code entirely and relaunch.

## Installation

npm:
```sh
npm install @senseyeinc/react-native-senseye-sdk`
```

yarn:
```sh
yarn add @senseyeinc/react-native-senseye-sdk
```

## Usage

You can then import task components into your React application. For example:
```javascript
import { Experiments } from '@senseyeinc/react-native-senseye-sdk'

<Experiments.Calibration/>
```

If you prefer to build the SDK locally, clone this repo and run `yarn install` to get started.
