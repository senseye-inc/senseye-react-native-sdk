        Calibration is essential for mapping the position and movement of the
        particpant's eyes in respect to their focal point on the screen.
        Measurements are fed into Senseye's models and assist in returning
        accurate results.
        {'\n\n'}
        This task seeks to gather these measurements by displaying a sequence of
        dots that will appear across the full extent of the screen. The
        participant is asked to look at each dot as it appears and continue to
        stare at the dot until it disappears.
