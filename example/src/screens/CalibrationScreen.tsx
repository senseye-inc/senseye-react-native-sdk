        Calibration is essential for mapping the position and movement of the
        participant's eyes in respect to their focal point on the screen. Measurements are
        fed into Senseye's models and assist in returning accurate results.
        {'\n\n'}
        This task seeks to gather these measurements by displaying a sequence of dots that
        will appear across the full extent of the screen. The participant is asked to look
        at each dot as it appears and continue to stare at the dot until it disappears.
